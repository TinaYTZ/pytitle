Okay, okay...

#
Oded Schwartz, Vice President of the Data Fidelity Dept.
in the Census Bureau, glad to meet you.

#
Sure, sure you can shower here there's plenty of warm water.
I have a boiler (spelled like "uncle") that fixes people!

#
OK sista', I'll get back to you.
I have a suit at the door.

#
Bye.

#
A minute of your time?

#
Do you wanna drink somethin' man?

#
As you most certainly have heard, under auxiliary legislation
"Databases, Data Fidelity, Entry & Transfer Act (2009)"

#
in accordance with the legal precedent "The State vs Blake Doe",
on failure of numeric estimation for a citizen's date of expiry

#
the erroneous record is to be ammended immediately
by verbatim realization of the datum, ex post facto.

#
Yeah, yeah, of course...

#
In our systems you're listed as dead.

#
Awesome...

#
While clearly, you're alive.

#
I'm here to correct the mistake.

#
Cool.

#
Sign this form please.

#
Whoa, you're a pro...

#
Are you goin' through Petah Tikva?

#
No, I'm on my way to Tel-Aviv.


#
Great, I need to get to Ramat Gan.

#
Okay...

#
I'm Michael Farrera, Mike.

#
Shany, nice to meet you.

#
I think I lost them.

#
They put thoughts in your mind and make you do stuff.

#
They know I know things.

#
I know they killed my uncle!
And you know why?

#
They had an error in the computer, it said he was dead.
 
#
So instead of fixing the error they decided to kill him!
They even made him sign a form, 203D!
#
203D!

#
Stop!

#
I'll get off here, I don't like being predictable.

#
Shany?

#
Oded Schwartz, Vice President of the Data Fidelity Dept.

#
on failure of numeric estimation for a citizen's date of expiry

#
the erroneous record is to be ammended immediately
by verbatim realization of the datum, ex post facto.

#
I didn't completely understand that...

#
Never Mind.
It's bureaucratic, that's my job.

#
So what...

#
what if I won't sign?

#
Then I'd have to request a signature from the next of kin

#
retroactively.

#
Hi, it's Oded. Schwartz. 

#
Requesting permission to use 
two additional bullets. 
#
Yes.
Yes, I signed.
#
Of course I'll fill in Form-55!

#
Thanks.

#
Oded Schwartz, Vice President of the Data Fidelity Dept.
in the Census Bureau, glad to meet you. 

#
Have you seen a young woman around here?

#
No, why do you ask?

#
I... need her to sign a form.

#
She's not here.

#
He's gone.
You can leave by the back door.

#
Oded Schwartz, I believe we've met.

#
Hello.
Oded again.

#
Requesting permission to work overtime. 

#
Is it approved?

#
I see.
OK.
#
We'll have to continue this tomorrow.
