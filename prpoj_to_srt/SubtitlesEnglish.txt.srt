0:0:4,0 --> 0:0:5,120
Okay, okay...

0:0:6,920 --> 0:0:10,840
Oded Schwartz, Vice President of the Data Fidelity Dept.
in the Census Bureau, glad to meet you.

0:0:12,40 --> 0:0:19,320
Sure, sure you can shower here there's plenty of warm water.
I have a boiler (spelled like "uncle") that fixes people!

0:0:19,760 --> 0:0:24,240
OK sista', I'll get back to you.
I have a suit at the door.

0:0:25,160 --> 0:0:25,880
Bye.

0:0:26,640 --> 0:0:27,880
A minute of your time?

0:0:32,760 --> 0:0:34,280
Do you wanna drink somethin' man?

0:0:34,600 --> 0:0:40,600
As you most certainly have heard, under auxiliary legislation
"Databases, Data Fidelity, Entry & Transfer Act (2009)"

0:0:40,600 --> 0:0:45,920
in accordance with the legal precedent "The State vs Blake Doe",
on failure of numeric estimation for a citizen's date of expiry

0:0:45,920 --> 0:0:52,520
the erroneous record is to be ammended immediately
by verbatim realization of the datum, ex post facto.

0:0:53,400 --> 0:0:54,560
Yeah, yeah, of course...

0:0:55,40 --> 0:0:57,0
In our systems you're listed as dead.

0:0:57,840 --> 0:0:58,560
Awesome...

0:0:58,920 --> 0:1:0,560
While clearly, you're alive.

0:1:2,200 --> 0:1:4,600
I'm here to amend the mistake.

0:1:5,440 --> 0:1:6,360
Cool.

0:1:7,360 --> 0:1:8,680
Sign this form please.

0:1:9,40 --> 0:1:10,560
Whoa, you're a pro...

0:1:35,40 --> 0:1:36,240
Are you goin' through Petah Tikva?

0:1:36,600 --> 0:1:38,280
No, I'm on my way to Tel-Aviv.

0:1:38,800 --> 0:1:40,680
Great, I need to get to Ramat Gan.

0:1:41,160 --> 0:1:42,80
Okay...

0:1:50,400 --> 0:1:53,0
I'm Michael Farrera, Mike.

0:1:53,680 --> 0:1:55,280
Shany, nice to meet you.

0:1:56,0 --> 0:1:57,520
I think I lost them.

0:1:57,960 --> 0:2:0,920
They put thoughts in your mind and make you do stuff.

0:2:0,920 --> 0:2:2,440
They know I know things.

0:2:2,440 --> 0:2:5,640
I know they killed my uncle!
And you know why?

0:2:6,320 --> 0:2:8,920
They had an error in the computer, it said he was dead.

0:2:8,920 --> 0:2:16,240
So instead of fixing the error they decided to kill him!
They even made him sign a form, 203D!

0:2:16,600 --> 0:2:18,760
203D!

0:2:25,480 --> 0:2:27,0
Stop!

0:2:28,320 --> 0:2:30,800
I'll get off here, I don't like being predictable.

0:2:47,680 --> 0:2:48,480
Shany?

0:2:49,960 --> 0:2:54,600
Oded Schwartz, Vice President of the Data Fidelity Dept.
in the Census Bureau, glad to meet you.

0:3:1,160 --> 0:3:5,920
on failure of numeric estimation for a citizen's date of expiry

0:3:5,920 --> 0:3:10,560
the erroneous record is to be ammended immediately
by verbatim realization of the datum, ex post facto.

0:3:14,40 --> 0:3:15,480
I didn't completely understand that...

0:3:18,320 --> 0:3:22,320
Never Mind.
It's bureaucratic, that's my job.

0:3:38,680 --> 0:3:39,960
So what...

0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:42,720
what if I won't sign?

0:3:45,560 --> 0:3:47,680
Then I'd have to request a signature from relatives

0:3:48,280 --> 0:3:49,160
Retroactively.

0:4:23,920 --> 0:4:27,720
Hi, it's Oded. Schwartz.

0:4:28,40 --> 0:4:30,0
Requesting permission to use 
two additional bullets.

0:4:31,120 --> 0:4:33,280
Yes.
Yes, I signed.

0:4:33,760 --> 0:4:35,560
Of course I'll fill in Form-55!

0:4:35,960 --> 0:4:36,560
Thanks.

0:4:49,240 --> 0:4:54,80
Oded Schwartz, Vice President of the Data Fidelity Dept.
in the Census Bureau, glad to meet you.

0:4:54,880 --> 0:4:57,120
Have you seen a young woman around here?

0:4:57,400 --> 0:4:59,840
No, why do you ask?

0:5:0,240 --> 0:5:3,320
I... need her to sign a form.

0:5:3,520 --> 0:5:4,880
She's not here.

0:5:10,960 --> 0:5:13,520
He's gone.
You can leave by the back door.

0:5:32,760 --> 0:5:36,280
Oded Schwartz, I believe we've met.

0:5:58,880 --> 0:6:1,880
Hello.
Oded again.

0:6:3,240 --> 0:6:5,240
Requesting permission to work overtime.

0:6:8,120 --> 0:6:9,320
Is it approved?

0:6:10,760 --> 0:6:13,280
I see.
OK.

0:6:29,280 --> 0:6:31,320
We'll have to continue this tomorrow.
